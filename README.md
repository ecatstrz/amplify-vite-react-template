## AWS Amplify React+Vite Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using React+Vite and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational React application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Project Structure

- `amplify/`: Contains the AWS Amplify configuration files for the backend resources.
  - `data/`: Defines the data model schema and authorization rules for the DynamoDB table.
- `src/`: Contains the React application source code.
  - `assets/`: Stores static assets such as images.
  - `App.tsx`: The main App component that renders the application.
  - `main.tsx`: The entry point of the React application, configures AWS Amplify, and renders the App component.
- `amplify_outputs.json`: Generated file containing the AWS resources' configuration.

## Data Flow and Frontend-Backend Communication

The React application communicates with the backend services through AWS Amplify, which acts as a bridge between the frontend and the AWS services.

- The frontend code in `src/` interacts with the AWS services using the Amplify JavaScript library.
- The Amplify configuration in `amplify_outputs.json` is loaded in `src/main.tsx` to set up the connection.
- Data is added to and retrieved from the DynamoDB table using the Amplify DataStore or API calls.

## Required Resources

- AWS Amplify: Provides a set of tools and services to build scalable and secure cloud-powered applications.
- AWS Cognito: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- AWS AppSync: Provides a GraphQL API for real-time data synchronization.
- Amazon DynamoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A fast build tool and development server for modern web applications.

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or by updating the `aws-exports.js` file.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Make changes to the code in the `src/` directory and see the updates in the browser.
6. Commit and push your changes to the repository.

## Deploying to AWS
